# Frugal Fare

The Ride-Share Price Simulator is a web application that utilizes geo-location to simulate the prices of ride-sharing applications like Uber or Lyft. It allows users to input their current location and destination to estimate the fare for a ride between the two points.

## Features

- **Geo-location Based Pricing:** The application uses the user's current location and destination to simulate ride prices based on real-time data or predefined pricing models.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can adjust parameters such as the type of ride (e.g., standard, pool, premium), time of day, and traffic conditions to see how they affect the estimated fare.
- **Interactive User Interface:** The user interface provides an intuitive experience for entering locations, adjusting parameters, and viewing the estimated fare.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The backend of the application is written in Java, providing robust and scalable server-side functionality.
- **Apache Server:** Apache Server is used to host the web application and serve HTTP requests.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The frontend of the application is built using standard web technologies, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Geo-location APIs:** APIs for geo-location services are used to determine the distance between the user's current location and destination and to retrieve real-time traffic data if applicable.
